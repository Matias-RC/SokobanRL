# SokobanRL

This repository implements a Sokoban game using Reinforcement Learning (RL).

## Game Logic

- `Logic.py` implements the core mechanics and rules of the original Sokoban game, ensuring that the game behaves as expected according to the classic design.

## Level Generation

- Random levels are generated based on the procedural generation techniques outlined in the 2011 paper *"Procedural Generation of Sokoban Levels"* by Joshua Taylor and Ian Parberry. This method ensures a variety of challenging and diverse levels while maintaining playability and difficulty balance.
